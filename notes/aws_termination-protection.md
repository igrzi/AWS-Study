# Shutdown Behaviour
The Shutdown Behaviour determines what happens when you shutdown an instance. 

We have ***two main shutdown behaviours***:
- Stop  | You **can** reinitialize your instance.
- Terminate | You **can't** reinitialize your instance.

# Termination Protection
This protection starts **disabled**, but can be turned on when creating/editing an instance.

This preventes accidental termination of an instance.
