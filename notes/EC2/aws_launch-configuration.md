# Launch Configuration (LC) | Launch Template (LT)

Both *Launch Configuration* and *Launch Template* are mechanisms for configuring available Auto Scalings that allow for specific provisioning models.

- Launch Configuration is a simpler version that allows ***item specifications***, like AMI, instance types, security groups, key pairs and storage.

- Launch Template is a newer version that allows not only for ***item specifications*** like in LC, but also for template versioning, and more advanced configurations, like Spot Instance e/or dedicated Servers.
